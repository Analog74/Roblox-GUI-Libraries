# Overview

Central sandbox for experimenting with Roblox GUI frameworks & plugin UI patterns:
- Wally-managed: Fusion, Roact, Aegis, Knit, Cmdr
- Curated external: Nevermore subset, RbxGui Library, Screen3D, Rex, Aero
- DesignLab: unified mounting harness, theming, benchmarking, registry-driven panels
<!-- Removed roblox-ts entry -->

Goals: rapid comparison, performance insight, reusable patterns for plugins & in-experience UIs.
